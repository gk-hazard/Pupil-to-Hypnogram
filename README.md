This repository contains MATLAB and Python code for our papers ([Keio Journal of Medicine]() and [bioRxiv]())__"Pupil dynamics-derived sleep stage classification of a head-fixed mouse using a recurrent neural network"__

an End to end sleep stage classification using pupil dynamics is available.

## Highlights

## Steps to create hypnograms from pupil videos
### 1. DeepLabCut (DLC)
### 2. MATLAB (extract feature inputs from pupil time-series coordinates)
### 3. LSTM

## Software environment
