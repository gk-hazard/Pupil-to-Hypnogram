This repository contains MATLAB and Python code for our papers ([Keio Journal of Medicine]() and [bioRxiv]())__"Pupil dynamics-derived sleep stage classification of a head-fixed mouse using a recurrent neural network"__

an End to end sleep stage classification using pupil dynamics is available.

## Highlights
- Sleep stage classifier using pupil dynamics and LSTM, the Recurrent Neural Network was proposed.
- The accuracy and F1 Score of our classifier for new animals has reached 86% and 0.77.
- It is found that the performance was improved when eye opening, pupil location, and pupil velocity were used in addition to pupil diameter alone.

## Steps to create hypnograms from pupil videos
### 1. DeepLabCut (DLC)
### 2. MATLAB (extract feature inputs from pupil time-series coordinates)
### 3. LSTM

## Software environment
